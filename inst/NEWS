Package: RDRPOSTagger
================

Version: 1.1 [2017-05-24]
- Updated models based on UD v2.0 (commit 14be0e413ab3df688b8e81784172bdb56e369232), now covering 45 UniversalPOS languages (65 models)
- rdr_pos now by default adds spaces around punctuations
- rdr_pos now spits out a data.frame with fields: doc_id, token_id, token, pos to comply with the 'text interchange format'
- .DICT and .RDR files are now zipped in order to reduce the size of the inst folder and be able to upload the package to CRAN. This required adaptation of the rdr_available_models code
- Universal POS tagging now dropped the UD_ prefix
- Added tests
